# PV Opt: Home Assistant Solar/Battery Optimiser v3.8.14

Solar / Battery Charging Optimisation for Home Assistant. This appDaemon application attempts to optimise charging and discharging of a home solar/battery system to minimise cost electricity cost on a daily basis using freely available solar forecast data from SolCast. This is particularly beneficial for Octopus Agile but is also benefeficial for other time-of-use tariffs such as Octopus Flux or simple Economy 7.

The application will integrate fully with Solis inverters which are controlled using any of:

- [Home Assistant Solax Modbus Integration](https://github.com/wills106/homeassistant-solax-modbus) 
- [Home Assistant Core Modbus Integration](https://github.com/fboundy/ha_solis_modbus) 
- [Home Assistant Solarman Integration](https://github.com/StephanJoubert/home_assistant_solarman) 

Once installed it should require miminal configuration. Other inverters/integrations can be added if required or can be controlled indirectly using automations.

It has been tested primarily with Octopus tariffs but other tariffs can be manually implemented.

<h2>Step by Step Installation Guide</h2>

<h3>1. Get a Solcast Hobby Account</h3>

<b>PV_Opt</b> relies on solar forecasts data from Solcast. You can sign up for a Private User account [here](https://solcast.com/free-rooftop-solar-forecasting?gclid=CjwKCAiAr4GgBhBFEiwAgwORrQp6co5Qw8zNjEgUhBee7Hfa39_baEWG-rB-GB3FFpiaIA5eAPHhahoC3vAQAvD_BwE). This licence gives you 10 (it used to be 50 🙁) API calls a day.

<h3>2. Install HACS</h3>

1. Install HACS: https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download
2. Enable AppDaemon in HACS: https://hacs.xyz/docs/categories/appdaemon_apps/

<h3>3. Install the Solcast PV Solar Integration (v4.0.x)</h3>

1. Install the integation via HACS: https://github.com/oziee/ha-solcast-solar
2. Add the Integration via Settings: http://homeassistant.local:8123/config/integrations/dashboard
3. Once installed configure using your Solcast API Key from (1) . 
4. Set up an automation to update according to your desired schedule. Once every 3 hours will work.

<h3>4. Install the Octopus Energy Integration (If Required)</h3>



This excellent integration will pull Octopus Price data in to Home Assistant. Solar Opt pulls data from Octopus independently of this integration but will extract current tariff codes from it if they are avaiable. If not it will either use account details supplied in `secrets.yaml` or explicitly defined Octopus tariff codes set in `config.yaml`.


<h3>5. Install the Integration to Control Your Inverter</h3>

At present this app only works directly with Solis hybrid inverters using either the Solax Modbus integration (https://github.com/wills106/homeassistant-solax-modbus) or the HA Core Modbus as described here: https://github.com/fboundy/ha_solis_modbus. Support for the Solarman integration (https://github.com/StephanJoubert/home_assistant_solarman) is in test. At the moment writing to the inverter is disabled pending further testing by Solarman users.

<h4>Solax Modbus:</h4>

1. Install the integration via HACS: https://github.com/wills106/homeassistant-solax-modbus
2. Add the Integration via Settings: http://homeassistant.local:8123/config/integrations/dashboard
3. Configure the connection:
    |||
    |:--|:--|
    | Prefix| solis|

    [![](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start?domain=mqtt)


<h3>7. Install Mosquitto MQTT Broker</h3>

1. Click the Home Assistant My button below to open the add-on on your Home Assistant instance:

   [![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c16bd5d7acfc6d5163636b546783e9217e27a401c1ac5bfd93a2ef5fa23e15fe/68747470733a2f2f6d792e686f6d652d617373697374616e742e696f2f6261646765732f73757065727669736f725f6164646f6e2e737667)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?addon=a0d7b954_appdaemon&repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhassio-addons%2Frepository)

2. Click on Install

3. Configure the Add-On as per the documentation: http://homeassistant.local:8123/hassio/addon/core_mosquitto/documentation

4. Either save the MQTT username and password in your `secrets.yaml` file or make a note of them for later.

<h3>8. Install File Editor</h3>

<h3>9. Install Samba Share and/or Studio Code Server Add-ons If Required</h3>

Both of these add-ons make it easier to edit text files on your HA Install but aren't strictly necessary. `Samba Share` also makes it easier to access the AppDaemon log files.

<h3>10. Install AppDaemon</h3>

The <b>PV_Opt</b> python script currently runs under AppDaemon.

AppDaemon is a loosely coupled, multi-threaded, sandboxed python execution environment for writing automation apps for home automation projects, and any environment that requires a robust event driven architecture. The simplest way to install it on Home Assistantt is using the dedicated add-on:

1. Click the Home Assistant My button below to open the add-on on your Home Assistant instance:

   [![](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c16bd5d7acfc6d5163636b546783e9217e27a401c1ac5bfd93a2ef5fa23e15fe/68747470733a2f2f6d792e686f6d652d617373697374616e742e696f2f6261646765732f73757065727669736f725f6164646f6e2e737667)](http://homeassistant.local:8123/hassio/addon/core_mosquitto/info)

2. Click on <b>Install</b>

3. Turn on <b>Auto update</b>

<h3>11. Configure AppDaemon</h3>

1. Use `File Editor` (or one of the alternatives) to open `/addon_configs/a0d7b954_appdaemon/appdaemon.yaml`.

2. The suggested configuration is as follows. This assumes that you are using `secrets.yaml` for your password information. If not then the `secrets` entry can be deleted and the `MQTT` `client_user` and `client password` will need to be entered explicitly.

        secrets: /homeassistant/secrets.yaml
        appdaemon:
          latitude: 54.729
          longitude: -2.991
          elevation: 175
          time_zone: Europe/London
          thread_duration_warning_threshold: 45
          app_dir: /homeassistant/appdaemon/apps
          plugins:
            HASS:
              type: hass
            MQTT:
              type: mqtt
              namespace: mqtt #
              verbose: True
              client_host: core-mosquitto
              client_port: 1883
              client_id: localad
              event_name: MQTT_MESSAGE 
              client_topics: NONE
              client_user: !secret mqtt-user
              client_password: !secret mqtt-password

        http:
          url: http://127.0.0.1:5050
        admin:
        api:
        hadashboard:

3. It is also recommended that you add the following entries to `appdaemon.yaml` to improve AppDaemon logging. These settings assume that you have a `/share/logs` folder setup using `Samba Share`.

        logs:
          main_log:
            filename: /share/logs/main.log
            date_format: '%H:%M:%S'
          error_log:
            filename: /share/logs/error.log
            date_format: '%H:%M:%S'    
          pv_opt_log:
            name: PV_Opt
            filename: /share/logs/pv_opt.log
            date_format: '%H:%M:%S'      
            format: '{asctime} {levelname:>8s}: {message}'

4. Open the AppDaemon Add-On via Settings: http://homeassistant.local:8123/hassio/addon/a0d7b954_appdaemon/info

5. Click on <b>Configuration</b> at the top

6. Click the 3 dots and <b>Edit in YAML</b> to add `pandas` as a Python package:

   ```
   init_commands: []
   python_packages:
     - pandas
   system_packages: []

   ```

7. Go back to the <b>Info</b> page and click on <b>Start</b>

8. Click on <b>Log</b>. Appdaemon will download and install numpy and pandas. Click on <b>Refresh</b> until you see:

   ```

That's it. AppDaemon is up and running. There is futher documentation for the on the [Add-on](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-appdaemon/blob/main/appdaemon/DOCS.md) and for [AppDaemon](https://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

<h3>12. Install PV Opt from HACS</h3>

  0. Make sure HACS "Enable AppDaemon apps discovery & tracking" is enabled - under integrations in HA https://hacs.xyz/docs/categories/appdaemon_apps/
  1. Go to HACS
  2. Select `Automation`
  3. Click on the 3 dots top right and `Add Custom Repository`
  4. Add this repository https://github.com/fboundy/pv_opt and select `AppDaemon` as the `Category`
  5. Download the app

Once downloaded AppDaemon should see the app and attempt to load it using the default configuration. Go back to the AppDaemon logs and this time open pv_opt_log. You should see:

  ```
  16:53:23     INFO: ******************* PV Opt v3.0.1 *******************

  ```

<h2>Configuration</h2>

If you have the Solcast, Octopus and Solax integrations set up as specified above, there should be minimal configuration required. 

If you are running a different integration or inverter brand you will need to edit the `config.yaml` file to select the correct `inverter_type`. You may also need to change the `device_name`. This is the name given to your inverter by your integration. The default is `solis` but this can also be changed in `config.yaml`.

    inverter_type: SOLIS_CORE_MODBUS
    device_name: solis

The `config.yaml` file also includes all the other configuration used by PV Opt. If you are using the default setup you shouldn't need to change this but you can edit anything by un-commenting the relevant line in the file. The configuration is grouped by inverter/integration and should be self-explanatory. Once PV Opt is installed the config is stored within entities in Home Assistant. It you want these over-ritten please ensure that `overwrite_ha_on_restart` is set to `true`:

    overwrite_ha_on_restart: true

<b><i>PV_Opt</b></i> needs to know the size of your battery and the power of your inverter: both when inverting battery to AC power and when chargingh tha battery. It will attempt to work these out from the data it has loaded (WIP) but you should check the following enitities in Home Assistant:

<h3>System Parameters</h3>

| Parameter | Units | Entity | Default Value |
| :-- | :--: | :--| :--:|
| Battery Capacity| Wh| `number.pvopt_batter_capacity_wh` | 10000|
| Inverter Power | W | `number.pvopt_inverter_power_watts` | 3600 |
| Charger Power | W | `number.pvopt_charger_power_watts` | 3500 |
| Inverter Efficiency | % | `number.pvopt_inverter_efficiency` | 97% |
| Charger Efficiency | % | `number.pvopt_charger_efficiency` | 91% |

There are then only a few things to control the optimisation process.  These have been grouped as follows:

<h3>Control Parameters</h3>
These are the main parameters that will control how PV Opt runs:

| Parameter | Units | Entity | Default | Description |
|:--|:--:| :-- | :--:|:--|
| Read Only Mode | `on`/`off` | `switch.pvopt_read_only` | On | Controls whether the app will actually control the inverter. Start with this on until you are happy the charge/discharge plan makes sense.
| Optimise Charging | `on`/`off` | `switch.pvopt_forced_charge` | On | Controls whether the app will calculate an Optimised plan. If `off` only the Base forecast will be updated.
| Optimise Discharging | `on`/`off` | `switch.pvopt_forced_discharge` | On | Controls whether the app will allow for forced discharge as well as charge
| Allow Cyclic | `on`/`off` | `switch.pvopt_allow_cyclic` | On | Controls whether the app will allow cycles of alternating charge/discharge |
| Solar Forecast | `select`| `select.pvopt_solar_forecast` | Solcast | Selects which Solcast to use (Most Likely, 10% or 90%)|
| Optimser Frequency | minutes | `number.pvopt_optimise_frequency_minutes` | 10 | Frequency of Optimiser calculation |

<h3>Consumption Parameters</h3>
These parameters will define how PV Opt estimates daily consumption:

| Parameter | Units | Entity | Default | Description |
|:--|:--:| :-- | :--:|:--|
| Use Consumption History|`on`/`off` | `switch.pvopt_use_consumption_history` | On | Toggles whether to use actual <b>consumption history</b> or an estimated <b>daily consumption</b>
| <b>Consumption History Parameters
| Load History Days | days | `number.pvopt_consumption_history_days` | 7 | Number of days of consumption history to use when predicting future load |
| Load Margin | % | `number.pvopt_consumption_margin` | 10% | Margin to add to historic load for forecast (safety factor) |
| Weekday Weighting| fraction | `number.pvopt_day_of_week_weighting` | 0.5 | Defines how much weighting to give to the day of the week when averaging the load. 0.0 will use the simple average of the last `n` days based on `load_history_days` and 1.0 will just used the same day of the week within that window. Values inbetween will weight the estimate accordingly. If every day is the same use a low number. If your usage varies daily use a high number.
| <b>Daily Consumption Parameters
| Daily Consumption | kWh | `number.pvopt_daily_consumption_kwh` | 17 | Estimated daily consumption to use when predicting future load |
| Shape Consumption Profile | `on`/`off` | `switch.pvopt_shape_consumption_profile` | On | Defines whether to shapoe the consumption to a typical daily profile (`on`) or to assume constant usage (`off`) |


<h3>Tuning Parameters</h3>
These parameters will tweak how PV Opt runs:

| Parameter | Units | Entity | Default | Description |
|:--|:--:| :-- | :--:|:--|
| Pass threshold | % | `number.pvopt_pass_throshold_p` | 4p | The incremental cost saving that each iteration of the optimiser needs to show to be included. Reducing the threshold may marginally reduce the predicted cost but have more marginal charge/discharge windows. |
| Slot threshold | % | `number.pvopt_slop_throshold_p` | 1p | The incremental cost saving that each 30 minute slot of the optimiser needs to show to be included. Reducing the threshold may marginally reduce the predicted cost but have more marginal charge/discharge windows. |
| Power Resolution | W | `number.pvopt_forced_power_group_tolerance` | 100 | The resolution at which forced charging / discharging is reported. Changing this will change the reporting of the charge plan but not the actual detail of it. |


<h2>Output</h2>

The app always produces a Base forecast of future battery SOC and the associated grid flow based on the forecast solar performance, the expected consumption and prices with no forced charging or discharging from the grid.. The total cost for today and tomorrow is written to `sensor.pvopt_base_cost` and the associated SOC vs time is written to the attributes of this entity allowing it to be graphes using `apex-charts`.

If `Optimise Charging` is enabled, an optimsised charging plan is calculated and writtemt to `sensor.pvopt_opt_cost`. This will also include a list of forced charge and discharge windows.

The easiest way to control and visualise this is through the `pvopt_dashboard.yaml` Lovelace yaml file included in this repo. Note that you will need to manually paste this into a dashboard and edit the charts to use the correct Octopus Energy sensors:

![Alt text](image-1.png)

This dashboards uses a couple of template sensors and time which will need adding to `/homeassistant/configuration.yaml`:

```
template:
  - sensor:
    - name: "Solis Grid Export Power"
      unique_id: solis_grid_export_power
      unit_of_measurement: W
      device_class: power
      state_class: measurement
      state: >-
        {{max(states('sensor.solis_meter_active_power') | float(0),0)}}    

    - name: "Solis Grid Import Power"
      unique_id: solis_grid_import_power
      unit_of_measurement: W
      device_class: power
      state_class: measurement
      state: >-
        {{max(-(states('sensor.solis_meter_active_power') | float(0)),0)}}

sensor:
  - platform: time_date
    display_options:
      - 'time'
      - 'date'
      - 'date_time'
      - 'date_time_utc'
      - 'date_time_iso'    
```
The dashboards also depend on the following Frontend components from HACS:
 - template-entity-row
 - bar-card
 - card-mod
 - Stack In Card
 - layout-card
 - apexcharts-card


<h2>Development - Adding Additional Inverters: the PV Opt API</h2>

PV Opt is designed to be <i>pluggable</i>. A simple API is used to control inverters. This is defined as follows:

<h3>Inverter Type</h3>

Each inverter type is defined by a string in the config.yaml file. This should be of the format: `BRAND_INTEGRATION` for example `SOLIS_SOLAX_MODBUS`. 

<h3>Inverter Module</h3>

PV Opt expects one module per inverter brand named `brand.py` which includes drives for all integrations/models associated with that brand. For example `solis.py` includes the drivers for `SOLIS_SOLAX_MODBUS`, `SOLIS_CORE_MODBUS` and `SOLIS_SOLARMAN`

Each module exposes the following:

<h4>Classes</h4>

The module exposes a single class `InverterController(inverter_type, host)`. The two required initialisation parameters are:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :--| :--: | :--|
|`inverter_type`| `str` | The `inverter_type` string from the `config.yaml` file
|`host` | `PVOpt` | The instance of `PV Opt` that has instantiated the inverter class. This allows the class to, for instance, write to the main log file simply be setting `self.log=host.log` and then calling `self.log()`

<h4>Class Attributes</h4>

The `InverterController` class must expose the following:

| Attribute | Key | Type | Description | Example from `SOLIS_SOLAX_MODBUS`|
|:--| :--:|:--:|:--|:--|
|`.config`| | `dict`| This dict contains all the names of all the entities that PV Opt requires to run plus a few other parameters that are common to all inverters. Some entries must be an `entity_id`: keys for these itesms start with `id_`. Others may be `enitity_id`s or numbers. `entity_id`s should ideally include `{device_name}` to allow for the subsititution of a defined device name where appropriate. |
||`maximum_dod_percent` | `str` / `int`| Maximum depth of discharge - nay be an entity_id or a number | `number.{device_name}_battery_minimum_soc`|
||`update_cycle_seconds` |`int`| Time in seconds between HA updates | 15|
||`supports_hold_soc` |`bool`| Flags whether the integration supports holding a fixed SOC | `true`|
||`id_battery_soc` | `str`|`entity_id` of Battery State of Charge | `number.{device_name}_battery_soc`|

<h4>Methods</h4>

The `InverterController` class must expose the following:

|Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |
|:--| :-- | :--: | :--|
|`.enable_timed_mode()` | - | `None` | Switches the inverter mode to support timed changing and discharging |
|`.control_charge()` | `enable: bool` | `None` | Enable or disable timed charging |
| | `start: datetime, optional` |  | Start time of timed slot (default = don't set start) |
| | `end: datetime, optional` |  | End time of timed slot (default = don't set end) |
| | `power: float, optional` |  | Maximum power of timed slot (default = don't set power) |
|`.control_discharge()` | `enable: bool` | `None` | Enable or disable timed discharging |
| | `start: datetime, optional` |  | Start time of timed slot (default = don't set start) |
| | `end: datetime, optional` |  | End time of timed slot (default = don't set end) |
| | `power: float, optional` |  | Maximum power of timed slot (default = don't set power) |
|`.hold_soc()` | `soc` | `None` | Switch inverter mode to hold specified SOC (if supported) |


<h4>PV Opt Methods Available to the Inverter</h4>

The following methods may be useful for the inverter to call. If `self.host` is initialised to `host` they can be called using `self.host.method()`. As PV Opt is a sub-class of `hass.HASS` it includes all the AppDAemon methods listed here: https://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/AD_API_REFERENCE.html 

|Method | Parameters | Returns / Decsription | 
|:--| :-- | :-- |
| `self.host.log`| `string`| Write `string` to the log file.
||`level: str, optional`| Optionally set the error level (default = `INFO`) |
| `self.host.get_state()`| `entity_id` | Home Assitant state of the entity |
|| `attributes: str, optional`| If attributes is set the attribute rather than the state is returned. If attribute is set to all a `dict` of all attributes is returned.
| `self.host.set_state()`| `state` | Set the Home Assitant state of the entity and optionally the attributes. Returns a `dict` of the new state|
||`entity_id: str`|
|| `attributes: dict, optional`|
| `self.host.entity_exists()` | `entity_id: str` | `bool` that confirms whether an entity exists in Home Assistant |
| `self.host.call_service()` | `service: str` | Call `service` in Home Assistant|
||`data: dict, optional`| Data to be supplied to the service e.g. for writing to the Solis Modbus registers: `data={"hub": "solis", "slave": 1, "address": 43011, "value": 15}`
